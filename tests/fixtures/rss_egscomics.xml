<p>Firstly, I'm sorry. I messed up. What I'm apologizing for should be clear by the end of this commentary.</p><p>I edited the previous page a bit for clarity, and to better fit with this one. The edit is objectively superior to the original if for no other reason than the line "sets off Magic's future irony sensors".</p><p>As said in the comic, I came up with name-based affinities as a joke about certain names in fiction. It was meant to be about names people have had all their lives turning out to be weirdly convenient in ways that the people who named them couldn't possibly have predicted.<br></p><p>Examples include Otto Octavius of <i>Spider-Man</i>, the man who would become Doctor Octopus, and Remus Lupin of <i>Harry Potter</i>, a name that most definitely references wolves (more than I myself realized before I learned a bit of Roman history and the significance of "Remus").</p><p>Also, as someone pointed out to me after the last comic, a whole BUNCH of characters in the <i>Ace Attorney</i> series (seriously, the very first witness you face in that game is named "Mr. Sahwit").</p><p>So it's just a joke about there being an explanation for that sort of nonsense in EGS. What, a huge coincidence? Nuh-uh! Magic saw a chance for IRONY! Or appropriateness, which is sort of the opposite of irony? Depends on the specifics.</p><p>I made a couple of mistakes, however. Firstly, I didn't drive home enough how rare name-based affinities are. From the feedback I got after the last comic, it was evident that many people interpreted it as applying to everyone, with general name origins potentially affecting affinity.</p><p>That was not my intent. This is meant to apply to the sort of names one finds in fiction that make people groan about how absurd they are, such as "Woody Treechomp" for a guy who turns into a mutant beaver lumberjack later in life.</p><p>Secondly, and this is the bigger mistake, I failed to consider that many people change their names later in life, and that many readers of EGS in particular would reasonably have a problem with the idea of a name chosen at birth having power like that.</p><p>It's a problem that's obvious in retrospect, and I missed it while being focused on the whole "ha ha, fictional on the nose names are SILLY". I apologize for that.</p><p>So I changed things a bit. Absurd names chosen at birth can still result in name-based affinities, but not if the person doesn't accept the name they were given, and first name changes CAN result in name-based affinities if done for very personal reasons, but aren't likely to unless they coincidentally result in a pun when combined with the last name (essentially no more or less rare than if a name is never changed).</p><p>Granted, as Lisa said, there are potential loopholes here, such as changing the last name before changing the first, but that sort of intentional manipulation might mess up such a thing, so... Best odds are coincidence and accidentally gaining a name-based affinity.</p><p>Parents can still try to manipulate a name-based affinity, however, which is a potentially more sinister aspect of what is otherwise just intended as a joke.</p><p><i>(It's maybe potentially possible I have a character this has happened to in mind.)</i></p><p>As for last names changing due to marriage, I don't think that affects such affinities? Maybe if it happens before an emotionally first name change, but I'm not sure. It's unlikely to come up, but if it does, that would be the time to settle it.</p><p>Also, no tell Susan, but "Tiffany S Pompoms" actually would count due to Magic's sense of irony and Susan's own thoughts about the name, and the only reason she doesn't have an irrelevant name-based affinity for cheerleading magic is because her inherited affinity for magic weaponry took precedence.</p><p>--</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/fantasywasteland-03"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>The letter was going to be comically brief to the point of earning a "that's it?" reaction, but it turned out I actually had a decent amount to say. Go figure.</p><p><b>Panel Two</b></p><p>Seriously, I find aversion to the idea of changing genders weird. It's just something I accept a lot of people wouldn't want to do without really getting it myself.</p><p>The whole "eighties and nineties" thing is pretty significant. It was like living in a drought, and the water you could find was often of questionable quality.</p><p>As for trans people "getting in on" transformation, it sort of reached the point for me where it just felt weird not to address that. It also seemed natural to make that one of the reasons for wanting to make magic accessible to everyone, and to put an end once and for all to Tedd overcompensating and have him brace being http://egscomics.com//comic/2014-07-01"&gt;genderfluid.</p><p>Which, incidentally, I was terrified of doing. I did not expect anything close to the amount of positive feedback I got after that. I was way more used to criticism, and was mostly expecting more of that. The positive feedback was a pleasant surprise after all the anxiety that lead up to it.</p><p><b>My Sinister Agenda!</b></p><p>My sinister agenda is I'm writing characters and stories I want to write.</p><p>Evil, I know.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Susan</b></p><p>When I first introduced Susan finding people and scenarios attractive while lacking desire to be an active participant in said scenarios, I wasn't thinking "well, here's another demographic to check off on this checklist I OBVIOUSLY have and am just trying to complete".<br></p><p>I was thinking "this is sort of how I am, I've never seen it in fiction, it seems appropriate for Susan, here we go". Since then, I've gotten a lot of questions about Susan being Ace.</p><p>My general response has been "uhhhh I dunno? I didn't even know this general description was in the spectrum? Maybe she'll find herself wanting to be do 'http://egscomics.com//comic/2017-10-27"&gt;things' with someone someday? Maybe not? I don't really want to attach a label I might go back on later. Also there's a personal aspect."</p><p>I apologize to everyone who finds this answer disappointing, but it is how I honestly feel about it.</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/fantasywasteland-01"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>Hooray! They found potions to fix the cat girl thing!</p><p>Why is no one else "hooraying"? Is it not the hooraying time?</p><p><b>A Common Question</b></p><p>This has been asked a lot over the years, but I paraphrased the person who specified that it wasn't a complaint, because yay for them.</p><p>As for something resembling an actual answer, I'm gonna do that on the next page, because the ACTUAL question I answered today was "are all the main cast LGBT+", and I'm just going to sneakily pretend I was only answering one question over the course of two pages (but don't tell anyone).</p><p>One reason I wanted to do this was because Sarah is often listed as the exception, but Sarah *can* find women attractive. It's true that she has a general preference for men, but that's not the whole story, either.</p><p>Another reason is because I obviously have a thing for Noah and Elliot playing basketball. And Susan being cutely awkward, and... Look, there was a lot I wanted to draw on this page.</p><p>And no, I don't know what the heck Catalina is wearing. Catalina, where did you get that outfit?

<p>http://egscomics.com//comic/tsos-45"&gt;- As recently mentioned in <i>The Secret Of Sam</i></p><p>Giving Elliot pigtails and posing him to make a silly face is most assuredly the only idea I had for an example of Sarah getting caught in an awkward simulated time stop moment, and any claims otherwise are lies and slander.</p><p>Also, I was going to have the party's healer, Sarah, resolve this shrunken curvy catgirl nonsense, but I wanted to do this question and she's in the example, which could be confusing, so the nonsense continues.</p><p><b>Restricted Spells</b></p><p>Sarah's spell in particular is noted here due to http://egscomics.com//comic/question-mark-07"&gt;the warning Pandora gave Sarah about her spell.</p><p>Pandora mentioned the last person Tedd's father found with the spell got "strong-armed into government work". How exactly that wound up happening wasn't specified, but the point is that they already found someone, and magic agents are presumably not running around with simulated time stop spells.</p><p>It remains someone a very select few can do, in part due to power requirements, but mostly due to affinity requirements.</p><p>And yeah, there's the meta reason, too. Unless I want to have everyone running around with the Cheerleadra spell.</p><p>Do I, though? No. Well, maybe... No. Possibly... No. Maybe just the non-super powered part...?</p><p>...I'll get back to you.</p><p>--</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-70"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>I know this isn't much of a question, but it has been asked, and it had to happen after I thought of that last panel. That said, it is absolutely true that I will ask my followers for information and feedback on things.</p><p>On the subject of research, after the previous comic, I would like to note that I don't think it would be impossible for me to intentionally include a character within the autism spectrum. I just don't feel prepared to do so at this time, and would require assistance if I ever were to do so, as the research I have already done simply on the basis of trying to figure out things about myself has more often than not left me confused.</p><p>I feel I possibly have a clearer picture today than I did the day before, however, thanks to someone sending me a list of potential indicators. This list included relaxing via movement (as opposed to standing still), fidgeting, desire for tactile feedback, issues with speech development, being oversensitive to certain stimuli, not naturally getting sarcasm or the concept of personal space...</p><p>Really, there was a lot there, but what stunned me about the list was that there was only a couple things on it I wasn't sure about due to my age, and everyone I was sure about, the answer was "very yes".</p><p>I hate standing still. I always pace and move around if it's an option. I've just now noticed I'm tapping my foot back and forth for seemingly no reason while typing this, which isn't at all out of the ordinary for me. I'm back to this part of the commentary after writing the rest for editing, and I started shaking my legs at some point for reasons that are beyond my awareness.</p><p>I have a speech impediment that can still show at times if I'm unfocused or tired, and had to take special speech classes with like 2-3 other people out of the whole school all the way through Junior High.</p><p>I'm really sensitive to sound. I turn TVs and such down much lower than most people, and I don't know if this is weird, but I can often hear if something is simply plugged in even if it's not doing anything. I have trouble working in rooms with lots of people talking. In college, had trouble getting things done in the computer lab because I couldn't filter out everyone talking, and I had a tendency to use headphones because I had to block everyone out.</p><p>And yet, somehow, I often have trouble hearing what people have said and have to ask them to repeat themselves, which I find all sorts of weird.</p><p>I'm uncertain about the sarcasm thing, but I I've mentioned incidents of misunderstanding, and I'm unsure about the personal space thing, because, because I don't like being touched or big crowds these days.</p><p>And I have no idea if this is related to anything, but I have this weird thing in which I rest my arm on top of my head when lounging in a chair, and I've never had any idea why I do it, and now I'm being told about how some people feel security from weight and pressure being on them, and I'm wondering if it could explain even THAT nonsense.</p><p>So... Um... I don't think a lot of that is applicable to my characters? I never really thought about most of that before now beyond occasionally thinking "yeah, that's one of my quirks", but... I kinda sorta have to go from "I don't know, but it would explain a lot" to "I don't know, but it sounds probable".</p><p>My understanding is it's alarming expensive and lengthy to get a diagnosis, however, and at this point, I don't really see what benefit it would be to me beyond being able to say something with greater certainty. As is, I can read more up on it and try things that are suggested for relaxation and the like and see if they work for me. At my age, as I am now, that seems the most sensible course of action.</p><p>Anyway, yeah, one of the first things I did after waking up was read that list, and it blew my fragile little mind. Also, I started writing this commentary feeling like I didn't know what I was going to write, and it suddenly snowballed into a... Well, I was going to say "a stream of consciousness", but that would suggest the snowball melted, wouldn't it. Um...</p><p>Well, you get what I mean. I wrote a lot. And wound up sharing a lot of personal stuff. Ah well. For the record, my speech impediment in primarily issues with "th" and "sh". I have, at times, effectively said "vat" or "fat" instead of "that". I have chosen to find that amusing rather than be embarrassed by it, so enjoy!</p><p>Also, I very, VERY carefully say "sit", or avoid it altogether o_o</p><p>--</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-69"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>The answer to Lisa's question was that there wasn't room for a goblin fight in the background to lighten the mood.</p><p>There's a whole lot of "maybe" here, both in regard to my characters and myself. None of what Amanda says on the subject here is a joke, and I don't think it's unreasonable that it's left me with a lot of questions.</p><p>As for the "it would explain a lot", one example is that I've considered it might explain this:</p><p>Other people felt strange and alien to me while growing up, and I can recall several incidents in which I utterly failed to pick on  language, expressions, and tones of voice. I recall these incidents clearly due to how bad the responses were, and the embarrassment of having misread situations that, in hindsight, seem like they should have been obvious.</p><p>I learned how to read people over time the hard way, and I also learned things about faces and  language from learning to draw. I eventually reached a point where it seemed like I was picking up on things other people were missing.</p><p>Which, naturally, made me feel more alien, because I went from not understanding people to wondering why so many others had trouble understanding people.</p><p>I used to think I had some natural ability in that regard, but looking back on my own development, I think it's a skill, not a talent. I suspect I'm naturally terrible at such things, but that terribleness forced me to learn such things the hard way.</p><p>Thing is, that's all just a guess based on what I can remember of my own past. Perhaps I don't remember things as clearly as I think I do.</p><p>Even if I do remember clearly, there are potential other explanations. This is the sort of thing that would have been far easier to confirm when I was younger.</p><p>But it's also just one thing on a list of reasons why these questions make me wonder, and I can't help but do so. As I've said, it could explain a lot.</p><p>A second thing it would explain, obviously, would be why people wind up asking this question so often about characters I write.</p><p>--</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-68"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>http://egscomics.com//comic/2018-02-19"&gt;- Voltaire after magic (sort of) didn't change</p><p>While the question in panel one has been asked, the more interesting question, in my opinion, is alluded to in panel five: "Why didn't Voltaire just keep Tedd from participating by telling Tedd about the second purpose of seers?"</p><p>Which is a very good question, and one I had to think about for a moment once asked. The simplest answer was that Voltaire simply didn't know that was an option, and it's the answer I feel is best as canon (regardless of whatever Voltaire might claim otherwise).</p><p>Fun fact, Voltaire could have succeeded by accident if he'd gone with another of his potential plans. He had considered befriending Tedd in order to turn Tedd against the will of magic under the guise of friendship. Had he done this, he would have told Tedd about the second purpose of seers without even realizing what the consequence would have been.</p><p>Ironically, he decided against that plan because he thought the odds of success were minimal, and yet it's actually the plan that would have been guaranteed accidental success.</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-67"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>I confess this is less a question people have been asking and more just confusion that just keeps happening.</p><p><b>Of junk storage</b></p><p>In my checking to make certain this "trunk" expression meant what I thought it did, and not something more that I naively did not know about, I was informed that it is primarily an expression in the United States.</p><p>Therefore, I wish to assure everyone unfamiliar with it in other countries that it has absolutely nothing to do with the size of one's rear end, and that we Americans are quite cultured and serious and above saying such things in such ways.</p><p>Besides, what difference would junk make to the size of a trunk? Vehicle trunks do not expand as a result of being full. That's simply not how they work, so how could that possibly be what the expression refers to? It cannot, obviously.</p><p>What it means if not that is obviously not important.</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-66"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>Sorry to leave Amanda and Lisa out of this comic, but Tensaided had something to say.</p><p>This is an understandable question to have in our day and age, particularly given that many would not have occasion to seek out such rental places, and would likely only stumble upon them. It is 100% true that they're still out there, however.</p><p>It's also understandable that, at this point, I AM VERY TIRED OF THIS QUESTION O_O</p><p>But, as I said, it's understandable to wonder about it. I'm just happy I now have this to direct people to instead of pointing out things said in panels two and three over and over again.</p><p>(Please don't jokingly ask this, either.

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say Rhoda is level 10 or so. That probably doesn't sound high, but we're talking Table Top RPG, not JRPG.</p><p>As for regular girl Elliot meeting "Mall" Elliot and there being such a separation between the two for this interaction to make ANY sense whatsoever? Um...</p><p>It makes total sense.</p><p>Somehow.</p><p>And no, there's nothing to see in that penultimate panel regardless of how much you zoom in. Trust me, I was very deliberate about that. Concern about that, however, almost made me make girl Elliot less shrunk, but I ultimately felt girl Elliot had to be shrunk a lot to illustrate the point well.</p><p>As for the SCIENCE! of all this, my understanding is that height will naturally impact who high or low someone's voice is, but isn't the only factor. I figure if your'e magically changing height, however, becoming taller or shorter would naturally have an effect.</p><p>Shrinking all around, meanwhile, shouldn't really work at all, and I figure whatever magical nonsense DOES make it work could easily lessen the voice change factor, because why not, it's magical nonsense. Past a certain point, however, I think it's fun for there to be a voice change difference, but not so much that it sounds like they've inhaled dangerous levels of helium or something (which, incidentally, can be dangerous, do not try at home, your lungs are designed for Oxygen).</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-64"&gt;- EGSNP</p>

<p>She did say there could be goblins.</p><p>I've addressed Tedd's pronoun preferences in a few places, but it's a frequently asked question, and I wanted to get it into an actual comic (not everyone reads this fancy text down here, or my various declarations elsewhere, of course).</p><p>I also felt like it would a jerk move to just describe Tedd's preferences and leave it at that, because what is desired by Tedd is not typical.

In the original, the outlines were black, and the lipstick a little lighter. I've lightened the outlines and slightly darkened the lipstick, which I feel works better.</i></p><p>This has been something I've wanted to clarify for a few weeks now.</p><p>I would have preferred to give the impression of a psychic force pressing against Sarah's cheek rather than pulling on it, but when it came time to actually draw it, I found it super difficult to get the point across. It mostly looked like Sarah was just making a weird expression, and distorting her cheek in a compressed manner was not looking how I wanted, either.</p><p>Given my options, I boldly declared "meh" and went with the cheek pulling. Even that might be more confusing than I'd like, but it should at least be less so.</p><p><b>Shoulder Massage!</b></p><p>As much as I deliberately intended for Lisa's dialogue to spark the imagination, I truthfully did not plan for Lisa to give Amanda a shoulder massage. I reached a point in drawing the comic, however, where I wanted them to be closer together on panel, and what better way to get them closer together than a delightful gal pal shoulder rub.</p><p>One may well note that I didn't get to that point until panel four, meaning I made the decision to have Amanda in that general pose before then. I mostly wanted to have her interacting with the background I'd made in some way, and that's what I came up with.</p><p>--</p><p>http://egscomics.com//egsnp/nanasecraft-62"&gt;- EGSNP</p>
